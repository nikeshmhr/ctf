# Visual Mode

## Notes
While visual mode is by no means necessary and won't inherently teach you anything new about the binary you're currently running. It allows the assembly to more human readable and provides a lot of options to enhance the visual appeal of radare and can definitely improve efficiency. Therefore I would state it's a valuable tool that you should know how to use. All commands involving visual mode start with `v`
