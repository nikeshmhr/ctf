```
Layer specific info is added on to the transmission called as encapsulation.

Layer specific names:
    Layer 7, 6, 5 => data
    Layer 4 => segment(TCP) or datagram(UDP)
    Layer 3 => packet
    Layer 2 => frame (only layer that adds footer/trailer)
    Layer 1 => bits
```

## Questions
1. How would you refer to data at layer 2 of the encapsulation process (with the OSI model)?
```
frames
```

2. How would you refer to data at layer 4 of the encapsulation process (with the OSI model), if the UDP protocol has been selected?
```
datagram
```

3. What process would a computer perform on a received message?
```
de-encapsulation
```

4. Which is the only layer of the OSI model to add a trailer during encapsulation?
```
data link
```

5. Does encapsulation provide an extra layer of security (Aye/Nay)?
```
aye
```
