## Questions
1. If you haven't already, background the previously gained shell (CTRL + Z). Research online how to convert a shell to meterpreter shell in metasploit. What is the name of the post module we will use? (Exact path, similar to the exploit we previously selected) 
```
post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter
```

2. Select this (use MODULE_PATH). Show options, what option are we required to change? (All caps for answer)
```
SESSION
```
