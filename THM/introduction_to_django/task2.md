# Unit 2 - Getting Started

## Notes
Startapp command allows you to initialize an app for your project. Django projects can have infinite number of apps.


## Questions
1. How would we create an app called Forms? 
```
python3 manage.py startapp Forms
```

2. How would we run our project to a local network?
```
python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```
