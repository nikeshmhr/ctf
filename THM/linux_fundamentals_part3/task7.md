# Binary - Shiba3

## Question
We've been through a lot in this section, and the challenge for this binary will reflect that. The first step is actually finding the binary, I'm not heartless though, so I'll give you the name of the binary. The name of the binary is shiba4.

The actual binary will check for two things, it will be checking that there's a directory called test in your home directory, how you create that is up to you. It will also be checking that inside the directory there's a file called test1234.
1. What is shiba4's password
```
test1234
```
